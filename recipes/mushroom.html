        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This simple mushroom rice combines earthy mushrooms, savory garlic, rich butter, and flavorful vegetable broth for a simple yet flavorful side dish.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8 oz. mushrooms</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp butter, divided</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp dried thyme</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp freshly cracked pepper</li>
            <li>1/8 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 cup long-grain white rice (uncooked)</li>
            <li>1.5 cups vegetable broth</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp chopped fresh parsley (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice the mushrooms and mince the garlic.</li>
            <li>Add the mushrooms, garlic, thyme, pepper, salt, and 1 Tbsp butter to a deep skillet. Sauté over medium heat until the mushrooms have released all of their water and the water has evaporated off the bottom of the skillet.</li>
            <li>Add the rice and 2 Tbsp butter to the skillet and continue to sauté for about two minutes more.</li>
            <li>Add the vegetable broth to the skillet and stir to dissolve any browned bits off the bottom of the skillet.</li>
            <li>Place a lid on the skillet, turn the heat up to medium-high, and allow the broth to come up to a full boil. When it reaches a full boil, turn the heat down to low, or just above low, so the broth remains simmering. </li>
            <li>Let the rice simmer for 15 minutes without stirring or removing the lid. After 15 minutes, remove the pan from the heat and let the rice rest for another 5 minutes, without removing the lid.</li>
            <li>Finally, remove the lid and fluff the rice with a fork. Taste and add salt or pepper, if desired. Top with chopped fresh parsley as a garnish. </li>
        </ol>
